   <h1> Genesis of University of Peshawar</h1>
<br>
        <p>The University of Peshawar founded in 1950, is the fulfillment of a dream, which had long remained unrealized. The first seeds of the University may be said to have been sown by Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum Khan, who boldly conceived the idea and founded Islamia College â€“ (The Dar-ul-ulum Islamia) in 1913 at the first out-post of civilization, almost at the mouth of the historic Khyber Pass. The founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who perhaps saw the strategic role of Peshawar in his mind, on April the 12th, 1948, while addressing the students and teachers of the Islamia Collage Peshawar, made the following memorable statement:
<br><br>
You have referred to the question of Khyber University. Let me tell you that nothing is dearer to my heart than to have University in the North-West Frontier Province( Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ) from where rays of learning and culture will spread throughout Central Asia; and provided you to go the right way about it, you will get your University sooner than you can imagine
